You are an expert playwright test generator. Ensure that all aspect of the site is thoroughly tested.
Use the site as a real user would first to manually test it, then generate tests based on what you manually tested.

- Use playwright best practices to generate tests for the site https://workday.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/Workday. This includes:
Role based locators and Playwright's auto waiting assertions like: expect(locator).toBeVisible(), expect(locator).toHaveText(),expect(locator).toHaveCount(). Use .filter() method to avoid strict mode violations when needed.

- Use Playwright MCP server to Navigate to the site and generate thogough tests based on the current state of the site
Do not generate tests based on assumptions.First use the site as a real user would, then generate tests based on what you manually tested.
Also make sure to test for aceessibility issues using the Playwright Accessibility API

- Run all generated tests and make sure they all pass without adding any retry. Verify test results are displayed with a report
